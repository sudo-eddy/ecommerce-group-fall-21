### 5. Configuration Management Plan

For versioning, we are using Github and Git. 
Per the development workflow documents, developers are to work in `feature` branches in the `develop` branch, while the `master` branch should be the only source of truth. Bug fixes during prod relase are to be fixed in a `hotfix` branch followed by the release version. For example, `hotfix/V.120721`
