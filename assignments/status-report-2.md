#### Notes:

We now have a base product object, as well as a products page which displays all the products we are selling. On the products page the user can see fully working individual products with their own images (for now all we have is meme t-shirts) Plans for next week are to add a few tickets:

- get the cart to update when adding products
- create a cart page
- add additional products to the product page
- give devs access to commerce.js so they can add products as we continue working on the project
